A minecraft plugin that integrates [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) and [FAWE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/) with custom blocks from [ItemsAdder](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9C%A8itemsadder%E2%AD%90emotes-mobs-items-armors-hud-gui-emojis-blocks-wings-hats-liquids.73355/). Works on versions 1.16 - 1.20.4+

There is already a plugin called [ItemsAdderWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/addon-itemsadder-worldedit.79012/) but it has some bugs. For example it does not work with the latest version of FAWE. That insipred me to create my own plugin for worldedit integration.

## What this plugin fixes from [ItemsAdderWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/addon-itemsadder-worldedit.79012/)
- Adds compatibility with the latest version of FAWE
- Now it can place and remove custom blocks everywhere in WorldEdit for example in commands, clipboard and schematics. Just everywhere you can imagine in WorldEdit
